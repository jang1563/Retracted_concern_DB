# Demo Results

This document captures the **artifacts and metrics produced by a clean `demo` run** on the bundled synthetic sample corpus. It is intended for readers who want to see what the benchmark produces without cloning and running it themselves.

> These numbers are a **protocol demonstration** on 16 synthetic records. They demonstrate that every stage of the pipeline runs end-to-end and produces the expected artifact shape. They are **not** real-data benchmark results. Real-data numbers will land in a future release.

## How To Reproduce

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m life_science_integrity_benchmark.cli demo
```

No dependencies are required. Outputs appear under `artifacts/sample_release/` and `artifacts/site/`.

## Snapshot Summary

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Snapshot date | `2026-04-09` |
| Total records in release | `16` |
| Public (auto-publish) records | `6` |
| Curator-review records | `5` |
| Task A 12-month eligible | `16` |
| Task A 36-month eligible | `12` |
| Noisy-date records (excluded from primary Task A) | `0` |
| Total extension tags attached | `10` |

Notice-status distribution:

| Status | Count |
| --- | --- |
| `none_known_at_snapshot` | 10 |
| `editorial_notice` | 3 |
| `retracted` | 3 |

Subfield distribution: `bioinformatics=5`, `biology=5`, `biomedicine=6`.

## Leakage Audit

The `audit-leakage` CLI step produced a clean report on this release:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Overall | **PASS** |
| Records checked | 16 |
| Leaked banned fields | 0 |
| Records missing feature provenance | 0 |
| Invalid event ordering | 0 |
| Snapshot violations | 0 |
| Feature cutoff violations | 0 |

Banned post-publication fields screened out of Task A features include `notice_status`, `core_tags`, `extension_tags`, `first_signal_date`, `first_notice_date`, `source_names`, `source_urls`, `allowed_feature_view`, `public_summary`, `auto_publish`, and `curator_review_required`.

Task A publication-time feature set: `title`, `abstract`, `venue`, `publisher`, `publication_year`, `subfield`, `is_pubmed_indexed`, `openalex_life_science_score`, `references_count`, `author_history_signal_count`, `journal_history_signal_count`, `oa_status`, `authors`, `institutions`.

## Splits

14 split manifests are produced per release: a primary time split and three grouped holdouts (author cluster, venue, publisher) for each of Task A 12m, Task A 36m, and Task B, plus noisy-date analysis splits.

| Split | Kind | Train | Val | Test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `task_a_12m` | time | 8 | 3 | 5 |
| `task_a_12m_author_cluster_holdout` | group | 8 | 3 | 1 |
| `task_a_12m_venue_holdout` | group | 7 | 2 | 3 |
| `task_a_12m_publisher_holdout` | group | 6 | 2 | 5 |
| `task_a_36m` | time | 6 | 2 | 4 |
| `task_a_36m_author_cluster_holdout` | group | 6 | 2 | 1 |
| `task_a_36m_venue_holdout` | group | 6 | 2 | 2 |
| `task_a_36m_publisher_holdout` | group | 4 | 1 | 5 |
| `task_b` | time | 8 | 3 | 5 |
| `task_b_author_cluster_holdout` | group | 8 | 3 | 1 |
| `task_b_venue_holdout` | group | 7 | 2 | 3 |
| `task_b_publisher_holdout` | group | 6 | 2 | 5 |

## Task A Baselines

Three baseline models are included: a metadata-only logistic regression, an abstract-text hashing encoder, and a metadata+text fusion model.

**Task A 12m** (horizon = 12 months after publication):

| Model | AUPRC | Recall@1% | Recall@5% | ECE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| metadata_logistic | 0.700 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 0.328 |
| abstract_encoder (hashing) | 0.700 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 0.478 |
| metadata + text fusion | 0.700 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 0.323 |

**Task A 36m** (horizon = 36 months):

| Model | AUPRC | Recall@1% | Recall@5% | ECE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| metadata_logistic | 0.917 | 0.333 | 0.333 | 0.093 |
| abstract_encoder (hashing) | 0.806 | 0.333 | 0.333 | 0.116 |
| metadata + text fusion | 0.917 | 0.333 | 0.333 | 0.291 |

On the sample corpus, AUPRC-by-subfield reveals a degenerate `biology=0.0` in every Task A configuration. That is an artifact of a small synthetic dataset where the test fold's `biology` slice has no positive label under this split seed; it is a useful reminder that subfield-sliced metrics are sensitive to cohort size and that real-data evaluation needs larger cohorts.

## Task B Baseline

A keyword-rules-over-provenance baseline classifies notice status and applies issue tags from snapshot-visible evidence:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Notice-status accuracy | 1.000 |
| Tag macro-F1 | 0.982 |
| Provenance coverage | 0.688 |

On synthetic data these are near-ceiling; the informative measurement is that the pipeline produces calibrated, provenance-backed outputs at all.

## Site Output

The `build-site` step emits a static, read-only evidence browser under `artifacts/site/`:

```
artifacts/site/
├── index.html          # paginated list of public records, with DOI/title/tag search
├── policy.html         # governance and public-display rules
├── changes.html        # per-release change log
├── records/            # one HTML page per public record
├── records.json        # structured record index
└── styles.css
```

The landing page displays the snapshot date, public-record count, and the explicit disclaimer *"This page summarizes public integrity signals and notices. It is not a determination of misconduct."* Records with non-notice external signals are not rendered publicly; they appear in `internal_curation_queue.json` for curator review instead.

## Test Suite

The repository ships with `tests/test_benchmark.py` covering dataset logic, label derivation, split construction, leakage auditing, baseline model fitting, site generation, ingest manifests, and the vendor-archive → raw-snapshot pipeline. All 20 tests pass on Python 3.13 with zero external dependencies.

## What Real-Data Results Will Add

When the in-progress OpenAlex + Retraction Watch + PubMed ingest completes, a future release will replace this document's numbers with:

- Record counts at the 10⁶ scale (vs. 16 here)
- Real distribution of `notice_status`, not a synthetic balance
- Subfield-AUPRC slices at sizes where the metrics are informative
- Comparison of metadata-only vs. text baselines on real abstracts
- Task B evaluation against real adjudicated labels

Until then, treat this document as a *shape-of-output* reference.
